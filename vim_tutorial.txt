There is EVEN a faster way to get to the spelling error. Using "f" for find (don't press "f" yet). First, press "5j"

------- typing "fs" will FIND the first occurrance of "s"

Breathe... no more ascii roads, make your way to the next line.

By the way. "u" in command mode is undo, ctrl+R in command mode is
redo. Remeber that if you mess up.

Yay!!! Now fix "=>" to be ">=" in the if statement below: (Hint: "xp"). When you're
done move to the next section.

    public void SayHello(int age)
    {
        if(age => 18) //this is the line with the error
            Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
        else
            Console.WriteLine("Hi!");
    }

By the way. "u" in command mode is undo, ctrl+R in command mode is
redo. Remeber that if you mess up.

Fix the misspelled variable names. (Hint: jurisdiction is misspelled)

    //remember "w", "b" and "f[char]"
    var jursidiction = "Federal"; 

    if(jursidiction == GetCurrentJursidiction())
    {
        Console.WriteLine(jursidiction);
    }

Press "zz" to center the screen horizontally, then press "j" to move to the next line



Insert the missing word, remember "i" to go into insert mode then <esc> to go
back into command mode. (Hint "jumps")

The quick brown fox  over the lazy dog.

You can also use "a" to go into insert mode. Using moves the postion of the
cursor right before going into insert mode. It's similiar to pressing "li".
Try it out:

The quick brown fox  over the lazy dog.


Insert the missing characters in the code below (using "i" and/or "a", use <esc> to go back into command mode)

By the way. "u" in command mode is undo, ctrl+R in command mode is
redo. Remeber that if you mess up.

    public void SayHello(int age   <--- this line is missing a parenthesis
    {
        if(age  18)  <-- this line is missing the comparison operator
            Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
        else
            Console.WriteLine("Hi!")   <----- this line is missing a semicolon
    }


Each one of the lines below is missing a semi colon, insert them using "a",
then go back into command mode using <esc>:

    Console.WriteLine("a")
    Console.WriteLine("b")
    Console.WriteLine("c")
    Console.WriteLine("d")

You can quickly go into insert mode at the end of a line be pressing "A" in command mode
You can quickly go into insert mode at the beginning of a line by pressing "I" in command mode
Use "A" to go to the end of the following line and add a semicolon

    foreach(var person in kids) person.SayHello(15)

    foreach(var person in adults) person.SayHello(18)

"o" is another way to quickly get into insert mode. "o" will put you into
insert mode AND add a line. Add the missing curly brace by placing the cursor

    if(a > 15) <-- place the cursor on this line a and press "o", then add the "{"
       Console.Writeline("a is greater than 15");
    }

"O" (capital o) will put you into insert mode AND add a line ABOVE the cursor
position. Add a comment "//TODO, refactor" above the if statement

    if(a > 15) <-- place the cursor on this line a and press "O", then type your comment
    {
       Console.Writeline("a is greater than 15");
    }



Fix all the errors in the code below, take advantage of "a", "i", "o" and
their upper case versions too (if needed)

By the way. "u" in command mode is undo, ctrl+R in command mode is
redo. Remeber that if you mess up.

"zz" to center the screen

Check list:
- missing parenthesis for method definition: hint "A"
- missing open curly brace for method definition: hint "o"
- missing "." and semicolon for the call to console writeline: hint "i" or "a", "A"
- bad/misaligned spacing on second call to console writeline: hint "I"

    public void SayHello(int age
        ConsoleWriteline("Say Hello")
      Console.WriteLine("Say Hi");
    }


Changing gears....

There are too many occurrances of the word "fox". Delete an occurance of a word
by using "dw" (delete word) in command mode. First navigate to the word "fox", then
press "dw":

The quick brown fox fox jumps over the lazy dog.
                ^
                |
                ------------ delete this with "dw"

Try it one more time (this time with the word "dog"), remember: "d" is for delete, "w" is for word.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog dog.
                                        ^
                                        |
                                        ------------ delete this with "dw"

Press "zz" to center the screen horizontally

In the next sentence, the wrong word is used. Change a word by using "cw" (change word):

- First navigate to the work "dog"
- then press "cw" to change the word, notice that you are automatically put
  into insert mode
- Type "fox", then press <esc> to go back into command mode

The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy dog.
                ^
                |
                ------------ change this with "cw", type "fox", then press <esc>

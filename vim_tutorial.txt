There is a faster way to fix that spelling error above, Move down 5 lines by pressing "5j"

The motion keys "w" and "b" are faster ways to move between words, use "b" to move to the beginning of this line, then "j" to move to the next line

Breathe... no more ascii roads, make your way to the next line.



Yay!!! Now fix "=>" to be ">=" in the if statement below: (Hint: "xp"). When you're
done move to the next section.

    public void SayHello(int age)
    {
        if(age => 18) //this is the line with the error
            Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
        else
            Console.WriteLine("Hi!");
    }

Fix the misspelled variable names. (Hint: jurisdiction is misspelled)

    //remember "w", "b" and "f[char]"
    var jursidiction = "Federal"; 

    if(jursidiction == GetCurrentJursidiction())
    {
        Console.WriteLine(jursidiction);

        press "p", after observing the result, then press 3j

 |_________ see! the "x" got pasted
Fix the spelling error on the next line. By using a combination of "x" and "p". Move down 4 lines by pressing "4j"

There is a faster way to fix that spelling error above, Move down 4 lines by pressing "4j"
                                                                                     _____ use "l" to move to the next arrow
                                                                                     |

(Press "w" to move all the way to the character under the arrow) The quick brown fox jumsp over the lazy dog.... press "5j" to move to the next line
                                                                                        ^
                                                                                        | 
                                                                                        |_____ press "xp".. this will switch the two characters

The motion keys "w" and "b" are faster ways to move between words, use "b" to move to the begining of this line, then "j" to move to the next line
j <--- ascii road! Time for some "w" and "b" practice!

There is EVEN a faster way to get to the spelling error. Using "f" for find. Lets try it out, press "5j"

------- typing "fs" will FIND the first occurrance of "s"

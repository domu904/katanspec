Start by pressing <esc>, that will put you in "command" mode. Now press "j".
See what happend? You're on this line now. "j" means down. Now press "2j".

What you did just there is "move down 2". Press "j"
Time to follow the ascii road. press "j", then press the key under the cursor
j <---- press "j" because j is curently under your cursor
j
j           lllllllllllllj
j           k            j
j           k            j
llllllllllllk            j
^                        j
|___ new "motion" key!   j
                         j
jhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  <---- "h" is move left, "k" (which you used earlier) is move up
Now press "i". This will put you in "insert mode". Type "I am awesome.<space>". Then press <esc> and then "j"
             j<----- you cursor should be here after you pressed "j", follow the ascii road press "j"

j            ^
j            |_ new key! "x" deletes a character!
j
llllj
jhhhh
xxxxxxxxxxj
The cool think about "x" is that whatever letter is deleted is put in the clip board. Move to the next line (press "j" in command mode)
 x     press "p", after observing the result, then press 3j
 ^
 |_________ see! the "x" got pasted
Fix the spelling error on the next line. By using a combination of "x" and "p". Move to the next line (press "j" in command mode)
